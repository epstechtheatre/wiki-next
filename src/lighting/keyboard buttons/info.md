## Welcome to the keyboard buttons guide

This folder will eventually contain information for every single button on the EOS keyboard. 

The goal of this section is to provide a simplified subset of the information already provided by ETC in a way that is more approachable to beginners. It also contains examples and usage cases.

Remember that at any time, you can hold down <LightingKey name="Help"/> and click any button on the keypad to open a help page right on the console
(click help again to close the help window).
